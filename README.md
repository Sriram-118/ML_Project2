# Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

This project applies machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of diabetes in individuals using the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset. It involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, evaluation, and feature importance analysis.

## 📊 Dataset
- Source: [Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plotly/datasets/master/diabetes.csv)
- Features include: Glucose, Blood Pressure, BMI, Age, and more
- Target: `Outcome` (1: Diabetic, 0: Non-diabetic)

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn (RandomForestClassifier, train_test_split, StandardScaler)

## 🚀 Project Highlights
- Data preprocessing with standard scaling
- Supervised learning with Random Forest Classifier
- Achieved high accuracy in predicting diabetes outcomes
- Evaluated model using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report
- Visualized feature importance to interpret model decisions

## 📁 How to Run
1. Clone the repo or download the `.ipynb` file
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook cell-by-cell
3. Modify the model or visualize results as needed
